* Unreleased
** Fix installation paths for source and compiled and files
   - Compiled files are now installed to the right 'site-ccache' path.
   - Guile modules are now installed to the current Guile site directory by
     default.

   Thanks to Aleix Conchillo Flaqu√©.
** Expand the Texinfo documentation
** API changes
*** =(smc context context)=: Bugfix
    The =<context>= would always have unexpected side effects due to field
    initialization with a single global instance of a <stack>. The instance
    would become shared between all the context in an application.

    Now the error is fixed.
*** =action:no-op= procedure moved to the context
    Now it's available from =(smc context char-context)= and =(smc context
    context)=.
*** All transition guards are now a part of Guile-SMC contexts
    There are modules in =(smc context)= name space that contain the
    transition guards.
*** =(smc context char-context)=: New module
    This module contains a context for handling streams of characters.
*** In =(smc fsm)=
**** New procedures in (smc fsm)
     - =fsm?=
**** Renames
     - =log-debug-transition= -> =fsm-log-transition=
*** smc: Handle FSM validation independently
    The =smc= tool now handles FSM validation (=--validation= flag)
    independently from e.g. compilation. Compilation stops when any problems in
    the output FSM are found.

* Version 0.1.0 (2021-05-01)
  First version of Guile-SMC.
