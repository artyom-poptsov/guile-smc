* Version 0.5.2 (2022-09-02)
** Bugfixes
*** =smc context=: Add missing =(smc core config)= to the FSM context
Add missing =(smc core config)= to the FSM context generated by =smc context=
command.
*** =smc compile=: Copy =(smc core config)= when standalone-copy target is used
Copy =(smc core config)= when =guile-standalone-copy= compiler target is used
with =smc compile= command.
* Version 0.5.1 (2022-09-02)
** Fix =log= core binding shadowing by =(smc core log)=
** Allow to set the log driver in Guile-SMC CLI.
See the =--help= for each =smc= action for the description of the new command
line options.

Implemented log drivers are: =syslog=, =file= and =null=.
** =stderr= logging now works with any log driver
Updated =(smc core log)= API now allows to use =stderr= logging with any other
driver.  That is, Guile-SMC will log messages to the =stderr= even for =none=
driver is set after =log-use-stderr!= is called with =#t=.

The =stderr= logging can be disabled by calling =log-use-stderr!= with =#f= as
the argument.
** PNG parser example now uses =null= log driver
That should make building in isolated/restricted environments (like in Guix)
easier.
** Guile-SMC tests now uses file log driver
Each test suite now logs to a file named =<test-suite-name>-smc.log= in the
=tests= directory.
** Update the Texinfo documentation
* Version 0.5.0 (2022-08-23)
** Compiler changes
*** =guile-standalone=: Add missing dependency for the target code
*** =guile-standalone=: API change: Target now produces =fsm-run!= procedure
Guile-SMC now generates =fsm-run!= procedure when =guile-standalone= target is
set to provide the same API as for other targets.
*** =guile-standalone=: Improve the output code layout
Code from different modules now separated by section headers.
** core: API change: =(smc core stack)= is removed
** =smc context=: API change: Implement intermediate contexts
Now =smc context= allows to generate intermediate contexts that can be used
from custom contexts.  Intermediate contexts can be used to implement some
custom code (e.g. user contexts) that is indifferent to target compiler.
** =smc context=: Allow to read input from a provided file
=smc context= now can read the input PlantUML data from a provided file.
** =smc profile=: Fix the help message
** =smc run= 
*** Ensure that the =context-thunk= is a procedure with zero parameters
*** debug mode: Now print stats for both parent and child FSMs
*** Improve help messages
** Update the Texinfo documentation
* Version 0.4.0 (2022-03-11)
** Add FSM profiler
   Add =smc profile= command.  Currently the profiler allows to measure the
   time a FSM spends in each state.
** Add =guile-standalone= compilation target
   This compilation target produces GNU Guile FSM code in a single file that
   does not dependent on Guile-SMC.

   All required Guile-SMC procedures will be copied to the output stream, and
   the extra procedures that are not used in the output code are removed by
   pruning.

   Here's an example of an output FSM (without the auxiliary code copied from
   Guile-SMC that normally goes before this procedure):
** Add =guile-standalone-copy= compilation target
   The compiler can be configured in such way that it will copy all the
   modules that are needed to run the output FSM so the FSM will not depend on
   Guile-SMC.
** =smc compile= now accepts =--target= option
   This option allows to set the compilation target.  Allowed targets are:
   - guile
   - guile-standalone
   - guile-standalone-copy
** =smc compile= now allows to pass input file as an argument
** =smc= now handles =--version= option
   The state machine compiler now either read input FSM description in
   PlantUML format from the standard input or from a file specified as an
   argument.
** Optimize the PlantUML parser
   PlantUML parser now about 25% faster.
** Add new examples
** Add =smc= man page
** Update/expand the documentation
* Version 0.3.0 (2021-12-04)
** Bootstrap PlantUML parser by itself
   Now Guile-SMC uses itself to generate an FSM for PlantUML format.
** =(smc version)=: New module
   The module contains information about the current Guile-SMC version.
** Guile-SMC compiler now adds version information to the output file
** Add new context modules
   There are now =(smc context context-char)=.  This module defines guards
   for the whole ASCII table.
** Allow to provide custom event sources for FSMs
** Allow to set entry/exit actions for each state
** Use a logger implementation from the Guile-Library
** Order of parameters of guards and actions is changed
** =(smc puml)=: Improve PlantUML syntax checking
** Guile-SMC now allows to set a FSM description
** =smc= functionality now split between sub-commands
** =smc= now allows to generate and analyze FSM context
   See =context= sub-command.
** =(smc fsm)=: API of =fsm-run!= is simplified
** Implement "run" command
   The =smc= program now has =run= command that allows to read and run a
   finite-state machine based on a PlantUML description right away.
** Add new tests
** Documentation updated
* Version 0.2.0 (2021-06-06)
** Fix installation paths for source and compiled and files
   - Compiled files are now installed to the right 'site-ccache' path.
   - Guile modules are now installed to the current Guile site directory by
     default.

   Thanks to Aleix Conchillo Flaqu√©.
** Expand the Texinfo documentation
** API changes
*** =(smc context context)=: Bugfix
    The =<context>= would always have unexpected side effects due to field
    initialization with a single global instance of a <stack>. The instance
    would become shared between all the context in an application.

    Now the error is fixed.
*** =action:no-op= procedure moved to the context
    Now it's available from =(smc context char-context)= and =(smc context
    context)=.
*** All transition guards are now a part of Guile-SMC contexts
    There are modules in =(smc context)= name space that contain the
    transition guards.

    =(smc guards char)= is removed.
*** =(smc context char-context)=: New module
    This module contains a context for handling streams of characters.
*** In =(smc fsm)=
**** New procedures in (smc fsm)
     - =fsm?=
**** Renames
     - =log-debug-transition= -> =fsm-log-transition=
** Changes in =smc= program
*** Handle FSM validation independently
    The =smc= tool now handles FSM validation (=--validation= flag)
    independently from e.g. compilation. Compilation stops when any problems in
    the output FSM are found.
*** Handle empty =modules= and =fsm-module= options
    The program does not throw an error when the options left empty -- it uses
    default values instead.
* Version 0.1.0 (2021-05-01)
  First version of Guile-SMC.
