* Unreleased
** Bootstrap PlantUML parser by itself
   Now Guile-SMC uses itself to generate an FSM for PlantUML format.
** =(smc version)=: New module
   The module contains information about the current Guile-SMC version.
** Guile-SMC compiler now adds version information to the output file
** Add new context modules
   There are now =(smc context context-char)=.  This module defines guards
   for the whole ASCII table.
** Allow to provide custom event sources for FSMs
** Allow to set entry/exit actions for each state
** Use a logger implementation from the Guile-Library
** Order of parameters of guards and actions is changed
** =(smc puml)=: Improve PlantUML syntax checking
** Guile-SMC now allows to set a FSM description
** =smc= functionality now split between sub-commands
** =smc= now allows to generate and analyze FSM context
   See =context= sub-command.
** =(smc fsm)=: API of =fsm-run!= is simplified
** Implement "run" command
   The =smc= program now has =run= command that allows to read and run a
   finite-state machine based on a PlantUML description right away.
** Add new tests
** Documentation updated
* Version 0.2.0 (2021-06-06)
** Fix installation paths for source and compiled and files
   - Compiled files are now installed to the right 'site-ccache' path.
   - Guile modules are now installed to the current Guile site directory by
     default.

   Thanks to Aleix Conchillo Flaqu√©.
** Expand the Texinfo documentation
** API changes
*** =(smc context context)=: Bugfix
    The =<context>= would always have unexpected side effects due to field
    initialization with a single global instance of a <stack>. The instance
    would become shared between all the context in an application.

    Now the error is fixed.
*** =action:no-op= procedure moved to the context
    Now it's available from =(smc context char-context)= and =(smc context
    context)=.
*** All transition guards are now a part of Guile-SMC contexts
    There are modules in =(smc context)= name space that contain the
    transition guards.

    =(smc guards char)= is removed.
*** =(smc context char-context)=: New module
    This module contains a context for handling streams of characters.
*** In =(smc fsm)=
**** New procedures in (smc fsm)
     - =fsm?=
**** Renames
     - =log-debug-transition= -> =fsm-log-transition=
** Changes in =smc= program
*** Handle FSM validation independently
    The =smc= tool now handles FSM validation (=--validation= flag)
    independently from e.g. compilation. Compilation stops when any problems in
    the output FSM are found.
*** Handle empty =modules= and =fsm-module= options
    The program does not throw an error when the options left empty -- it uses
    default values instead.
* Version 0.1.0 (2021-05-01)
  First version of Guile-SMC.
