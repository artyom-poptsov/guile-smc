* Guile-SMC PNG signature parser example
  The finite-state machine can be found in `png-signature.scm` file that is
  generated by Guile-SMC during the building process. The executable
  `png-signature-context.scm` is produced from `png-signature-checker.in`
  file.

  Usage:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
$ ./png-signature-checker.scm file.png
#+END_EXAMPLE

  The program exits with status 0 when a file signature is correct, or prints
  an error otherwise.
